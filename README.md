Proprietary Fingerprint Template Evaluation
===========================================

Proprietary Fingerprint Template Evaluation (PFT) is a series of public tests of
one-to-one fingerprint matching using proprietary fingerprint templates.
Proprietary fingerprint templates are files containing information about a
fingerprint that can only be understood by the originating software. Versions of
PFT have been conducted by the Image Group at the National Institute of
Standards and Technology (NIST) since 2003.

*Standardized* fingerprint templates are evaluated under NIST's [MINEX program].

Tests
-----
The current iteration of PFT is [*PFT III*][pft3-gh], which incorporates
testing of variable resolution imagery including 1 000 pixels per inch (393.7
pixel per centimeter), images from non-contact fingerprint acquisition devices,
and significantly faster testing. Previous tests include [PFT II](2010–2019)
and the original [PFT](2003–2010).

Communication
-------------
If you found a bug and can provide steps to reliably reproduce it, or if you
have a feature request, please [open an issue]. Other questions may be addressed
to the [NIST PFT team](mailto:pft@nist.gov).

The PFT team sends updates about the PFT tests to their mailing list. Enter your
