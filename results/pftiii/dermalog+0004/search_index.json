["timing-sample-dataset.html", "2 Timing Sample Dataset 2.1 Template Size 2.2 Template Creation Time 2.3 Template Comparison Time", " 2 Timing Sample Dataset A fixed sample of images randomly selected from the PFT III datasets are used to assess whether or not an implementation adheres to the minimum timing requirements set forth in the PFT III test plan. This sample is also used to provide an estimate on template size. The images and comparisons are identical to the “1K Sample Evaluation” from NIST’s PFT II evaluation, with the exception of the “IARPA N2N” dataset, which is new in PFT III. Table 2.1 shows information about the maximum dimensions and resolutions of the images in each of the timing sample datasets.

For PFT III, NIST is using new subject comparisons from each of these datasets. Additionally, PFT III adds comparisons of public and sequestered data collected as part of the Intelligence Advanced Research Project Activity (IARPA)’s Nail-to-Nail (N2N) Challenge. 3.1 Arizona Department of Public Safety The Arizona Department of Public Safety (AZDPS) dataset consists of plain and rolled impressions of all ten fingers. Figure 3.1 and Table 3.1 show the detection error tradeoff (DET) curves of all fingers not compared in other PFT tests. This data is separated by finger position in Figure 3.2 and Table 3.2 and again by impression type in Figure 3.3 and Table 3.3. Values made by combinations of fingers were generated by summing the individual similarity scores for comparisons of the individual finger and dividing by the number of values added. This technique is known as sum fusion. Figure 3.1: Detection error tradeoff of all comparisons from all fingers in the PFT III AZDPS dataset. Numbers in gray indicate the similarity threshold.

Participating Challengers deployed devices to capture a rolled-equivalent print. Approximately two-thirds of the ten-print data collected was released to the public as NIST Special Database 302, with the rest being sequestered at NIST for evaluations like PFT III. Information about the Challenge can be found in NIST IR 8210. Descriptions of the devices described by the device codes in the following figures and tables can be found in NIST TN 2007. 3.5.1 By Device The following figures and tables show the DET of all comparisons from select devices in the IARPA N2N Challenge. All probe devices imaged natively at 500 PPI, except for J, R, and U, which imaged at 1 000 PPI. The reference device, V, also imaged natively at 1 000 PPI. When these higher resolution devices are shown at 500 PPI, they were downsampled using NIST Fingerprint Image Resampler (NFIR). Figure 3.11 and Table 3.11 show results with 500 PPI probes against 1 000 PPI references. Figure 3.12 and Table 3.12 show the same probe images against reference images downsampled to the same resolution. Figure 3.13 and Table 3.13 show native 1 000 PPI to 1 000 PPI comparisons for supported devices.

It is thought that several fingerprint feature extractors downsample imagery to a lower resolution before extracting features. To test this theory, we downsample and compare source and reference imagery both captured natively at 1 000 PPI. All downsampling was performed using NFIR. Images were compared at all combinations of 100, 250, 300, 333, 500, 600, and 1 000 (native) PPI. Figure 3.14 and Table 3.14 show match rates against 1 000 PPI references. Figure 3.15 and Table 3.15 show match rates against 600 PPI downsampled references. Figure 3.16 and Table 3.16 show match rates against 500 PPI downsampled references.

The only data permitted to be stored in a MINEX-compliant template are minutia type (ridge ending, bifurcation, or unknown), angle, location, and quality, as well as finger position and image quality. PFT III templates have no restrictions on the contents of the template. The results shown in this section are computed based on the exact MINEX III dataset, but using the proprietary template generator and matcher from dermalog+0004. Note that while Dermalog Identification Systems GmbH may be a participant in both PFT III and MINEX III (perhaps even with the same identifier of dermalog+0004), it does not indicate that the same underlying implementation was used.
